    "\n",
    "One might be confused by the above statement. Let's get started by agreeing that X-ray is a form of wave, like light, sound or the water wave when we drop a pebble in a pond. What will happen when a wave encounters an obstacle. The waves might rebound, reflect, scatter or interfere each other knowns as _diffraction_. Diffraction is the most special case, it only happens when some conditions are met. Two waves will interfere only when the relative phases vary by 2$\\pi$ or more.\n",
